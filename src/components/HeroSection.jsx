            Volunteers are the backbone of Agamis daily operations. These are but some of the tasks taken on by our volunteers: delivering supplies or teaching classes in schools, monitoring project impacts, writing about Agamiâ€™s operations and impact, and assisting our fundraising efforts. Every day, our volunteers help to address the challenges faced in Agamis ambitious mission.
